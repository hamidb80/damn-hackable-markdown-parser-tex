# Hackable Markdown Parser

we're in 2025, age of AI, 
and still there is not a single simple markdown *extensible* 
markdown parser without quirks 
in any programming language open source.

I hate these *noobie* developers that 
would say "this requires major blah blah" 
for every single issue instead of actually doing
the right work. 
*(actually it's no surprise since they don't know how to program)*

this is an attempt to end my struggles and headaches, 
IN JUST A SINGLE DAMN FILE.
